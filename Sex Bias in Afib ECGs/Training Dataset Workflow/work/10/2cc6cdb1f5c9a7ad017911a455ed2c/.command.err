Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-1h_ho3b2 because the default path (/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
