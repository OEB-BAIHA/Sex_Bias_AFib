Matplotlib created a temporary config/cache directory at /tmp/matplotlib-z46tzp0z because the default path (/.config/matplotlib) is not a writable directory; it is highly recommended to set the MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable to a writable directory, in particular to speed up the import of Matplotlib and to better support multiprocessing.
